# Jdbc::Mssql

This Ruby gem loads the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC driver.
Install this gem and `require 'jdbc/mssql'` within JRuby

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jdbc-mssql'
```

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

This is a very minimal and basic sample.

```ruby
require 'jdbc/mssql'

connection_string = [
  'jdbc:sqlserver://192.168.1.3:1433',
  'database=sample_development',
  'user=sa',
  'password=sa_password'
].join(';')

connection = java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(connection_string)

statement = connection.createStatement

sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM types'

result = statement.executeQuery(sql_query)

while result.next
  puts [result.getString(1), result.getString(2), result.getString(3)]
end
```
